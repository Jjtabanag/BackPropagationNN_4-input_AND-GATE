# What is in this program?
This program contains backpropagation neural network libraries, contained in the following files:
- BackNeural.cs
- HiddenN.cs
- InputN.cs
- OutputN.cs
The main program is in the Form1.cs.

# How to Use
1. Set the number of hidden neurons.
2. Create new BPNN.
3. May pick either:
   a. Set number of training epochs per iteration.
   b. Train the Neural Network.
   c. Train until 0.9 possibility on the 1 1 1 1 (since 1 1 1 1 = 1 [true]).
4. May pick either:
   a. Test current inputs.
   b. Test all possible inputs.
5. View the outputs on the output log.
6. Reset the neural network model if needed.
7. Goto file tab to save or load weights on your current neural network model if needed.

# BUGS / ISSUES
1. Loading weights still do not show the number of hidden neurons.
